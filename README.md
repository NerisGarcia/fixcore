FixCore is a Snakemake workflow for producing high-quality core-genome alignments and phylogenies from pangenome analyses. It can either derive core genes from assemblies using PanACoTA, Roary, or Panaroo, or start from precomputed core-family FASTA files. Each core gene is aligned, trimmed, and curated to remove poorly aligned regions. Curated gene alignments are then concatenated to build a robust species-level alignment and a maximum-likelihood tree.

The pipeline includes the FixCore algorithm for curating core gene alignments. This algorithm uses the nucleotide and amino-acid alignments together with per-gene phylogenies to detect and remove problematic sequences.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Workflow overview

-   Input: assemblies or core-family FASTA files.
-   Optional core-genome extraction: PanACoTA, Roary, or Panaroo. Family thresholds are configurable in `config/config.yaml`. Defaults: PanACoTA 80% identity, Roary 95%, Panaroo 70%.
-   Multiple sequence alignment (MAFFT) per core gene.
-   Trimming (TrimAl) and curation using the FixCore algorithm.
-   Concatenation of curated gene alignments.
-   Maximum-likelihood phylogeny from the concatenated alignment with IQ-TREE 2 (GTR+G, 1000 bootstraps).

## Prerequisites

-   Linux/macOS (tested on Linux).
-   Conda (Miniconda or Mambaforge) recommended for environment management. If not installed, follow the [installation guide](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/install#quickstart-install-instructions).
-   Snakemake = 8.20.5. If unavailable, you can install it using Conda:

    ```bash
    conda create -n snakemake -c conda-forge -c bioconda snakemake=8.20.5
    conda activate snakemake
    ```

## Installation

Clone the repository or download a zip release:

```         
git clone https://github.com/NerisGarcia/fixcore.git
cd fixcore
```

## Quick start

1.  Edit `config/target.yaml` to set input data.
    -   Option A (precomputed core families): directory containing multi-FASTA files per gene family (`.fasta`).
    -   Option B (assemblies): directory with genome assemblies (`.fasta`), and set `core_tool` to `panacota`, `roary`, or `panaroo` in `config/config.yaml`.
2.  Adjust parameters in `config/config.yaml` as needed.
3.  Run the workflow:

    ```bash
    snakemake --use-conda -c 8
    ```

    We recommend at least 8 threads, but any positive integer is valid.


Alternatively, you can use the provided Docker container to run the workflow. First, make sure you have [apptainer](https://apptainer.org/) or [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/singularity/) installed. Then, you can run the workflow using the following command:

```
snakemake --sdm apptainer -c 8  
```

## Configuration and parameter selection
Workflow parameters can be changed in the configuration files:

-   `config/config.yaml`: global settings, including `core_tool` selection and parameters for pangenome, alignment, trimming, curation, and phylogeny.
-   `config/target.yaml`: input paths for genomes or core-family FASTA files and output directories.

See inline comments in these files for parameter descriptions.

## Outputs

-   Concatenated curated alignment of core genes.
-   Maximum-likelihood phylogeny for the concatenated alignment.
-   Intermediate files (per-gene alignments, trimmed and curated versions) to support downstream analyses.

## Python wrapper
A Python wrapper script `fixcore-runner.py` is provided for easier execution. It handles argument parsing and invokes Snakemake with the appropriate parameters.

First, ensure you have the required Python packages installed:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then add execute permissions to the script and include it in your PATH for easy access:

```bash
chmod +x fixcore-runner.py
export PATH=$PATH:$(pwd)
```

The script has the following usage:

```bash
Usage: fixcore-runner.py [-h] [-c CORES] [-g GENES_DIR] [-a ASSEMBLIES_DIR] [-p PREFIX] [-o OUTDIR] [-t {none,roary,panaroo,panacota}] [-th THRESHOLD] [-d]

Run the FIXCORE snakemake workflow.

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c, --cores CORES     Number of cores to use for the workflow
  -g, --genes_dir GENES_DIR
                        Directory containing the gene alignments to process
  -a, --assemblies_dir ASSEMBLIES_DIR
                        Directory containing the assemblies to process. Only if no genes_dir is provided.
  -p, --prefix PREFIX   Prefix for the output files
  -o, --outdir OUTDIR   Output directory for the results
  -t, --pangenome-tool {none,roary,panaroo,panacota}
                        Pangenome analysis tool to use. Only if no assemblies_dir is provided.
  -th, --threshold THRESHOLD
                        Threshold percentage for core gene definition. Only if pangenome-tool is not 'none'.
  -d, --use-apptainer   Whether to use Apptainer containers for the workflow.
```

As an example you can run the workflow with the test datasets included in the repository. For running with precomputed gene families:

```bash
fixcore-runner.py -c 8 -g path/to/fixcore/.test/alignments/ -o test
```
For running with assemblies and PanACoTA for core-genome extraction:

```bash
fixcore-runner.py -c 8  -a path/to/fixcore/.test/genomes/ -o test -t panacota
```

## Troubleshooting

-   Ensure `--use-conda` is used so all environments defined under `workflow/envs/` are created automatically.
-   If a rule fails, re-run with increased verbosity:
    -   `snakemake -c 8 --use-conda -p --printshellcmds`
-   Verify file extensions (`.fasta`) and directory paths in `config/target.yaml`.
